### Overview

Probably all of us have set redux with or without redux toolkit in our project. This is not a **how-to** article
about redux and react but there will be small introduction about these. In this article, we are mainly going to focus
on setting up redux and particularly **Redux Toolkit**, so that the application state will be accessible from both the
client side as well as on the server side of the Next.js project. By the term client side and server side, I am referring to
front-end and the back-end of the application. This is about the code that will run on the client side i.e browser and on the server
side when rendered by Next.js Server (will be talk on this more later). Let's discuss on Next.js and how it works as SSR with redux toolkit.

### Brief introduction to Redux and Redux Toolkit

Many of us have probably used the the combination of react(create-react-app) with redux. Redux is an amazing tool to
handle the state management of the application but it comes to one major draback i.e too much of **boiler plate** to achieve
one small functionality. This eats up large amount of your time from real coding. To come out of this situation, the creators
of Redux came up with **Redux Toolkit**.

<br />

**Redux Toolkit** => "_The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development_ "

It was created to address three common concerns of redux.

- Configuring redux is too complicated
- I have to add a lot of package to make redux do something useful
- Redux requires too much of boilerplate code

### Introduction to Next.js

Next.js is the next best thing for React applications. It is one of the most complete Frameworks
for creating React applications, providing best developer experience with all the features you need
for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching,
and more.

#### Next.js server side rendering

Next.js provides out-of-the-box support for server-side rendering of your page without any extra configuration
from your part.

### Combining Next.js with Redux Toolkit and Preserve State during SSR

First, we need to create a store.

<br />

```js:store.js
const createStore = (preloadedState) => {
  return configureStore({
    reducer: {
      nextRepo: nextSlice
    },
    preloadedState
  });
};
```

As you can see above, we pass the preloadedState value to the configureStore. This value is used
to HYDRATE the state with the server fetched data — or any other pre-existing data for that matter.

<br />

The second step is to correctly initialize our store depending on which side of the application
we are currently operating. As you can see below on the code snippet, we perform a check to see
whether our code is executing on the client-side or on the server, by checking the value of the window.

<br />

```js:initialize-store.js
let store;
export const initialiseStore = (preloadedState) => {
  let _store = store ?? createStore(preloadedState);

  if (preloadedState && store) {
   _store = createStore({ ...store.getState(), ...preloadedState });
    store = undefined;
  }

  // For SSG and SSR always create a new store
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return _store;
  // Create the store once in the client
  if (!store) store = _store;

  return _store;
};
```

You can see that if a preloadedState is provided to the initialiseStore method and a store has been
already created the new store that is created will include both the old state and the preloaded state
that in most cases will be the props they were fetching on the server-side.

<br />

Now let's use the above code snippet to hydrate our store. Suppose, I have a page named **board** and
in that I want to fetch all the boards in the SSR.

<br />

My code snippet would be something like

<br />

```js:boards.js
export async function getServerSideProps(context: AppContext) {
  const appProps = {}

  //initialise redux store on server side
  const reduxStore = initialiseStore({});
  const { dispatch } = reduxStore;
  const res = await fetch('https://trello.com/api/boards')
  const json = await res.json()
  dispatch(setStars({ boards: json.boards }));

  appProps.pageProps = {
    ...appProps.pageProps,
    initialReduxState: reduxStore.getState(),
  };

  return {
    props: {
      ...appProps
    }, // will be passed to the page component as props
  }
}
```

Now, we have the SSR fetched store data. We will fetch the object and pass it in the `initialiseStore` function to hydrate
the SSR data to the client side.

<br />

```js:boards-page.js
const BoardsPage = ({ initialReduxState }) => (
  // Pass the store state and initialise at the client side
  <Provider store={initialiseStore(initialReduxState)}>
    <Boards />
  </Provider>
)
```

Now you know the secret recipe for hydrating the SSR data to client side.
I have implement the same in one of my project ([Trello Clone](https://github.com/knowankit/trello-clone)).
Do check it out.

Thank You! 👋🏻
